## Design Choices and Features
- I Decided to go with a more seperated and modular approach where there is a page for overview, behavioral and technical analysis. I believe the information will be conveyed clearly this way and it is also easier to digest and understand as the user. 

- Layout has a navigation bar for the different sections aswell as a header for general information about the interview question.

- Overview page contains star ratings for each evaluation criteria alongside bullet points for strengths and weaknesses. I believe this is more optimal compared to a paragraph or a more detailed approach as the information can be understood and absored quickly, it's meant to be a way for the users to quickly understand how they performed alongside key takeaways. If the user wants to dive deeper they can go to the next sections or expand the tab to see a longer paragraph explanation. I wanted this page to be minimalisitc and easy to understand. 

- For the behavioral page I split the screen into 2 halves, one which displays the audio-to-text of the interview and the other has AI suggestios as well as some text for explanations. The scroll bar is replaced with the audio wave of the interview so that users can visualize where in the interview they are while also viewing the timestamps above the text. I originally included audio for this so that users can hear their voice while also reviewing the flow and context of the interview. I removed this later on as it causes the user to take much longer to read through the suggestions and see the areas of improvement. In my opinion it blocks the flow of learning and the audio is only useful for understanding tone and voice. This could be added on as an additional feature perhaps on another page. The AI suggestions will handle things such as usage of filler words or the content of what the user actually says, a stats card can also be added on to the page for general overview of what tendencies the user has during an interview. 

- The technical page includes the users code alongside examples of other solutions. The time and space complexity are given for all solutions. At the top there is a section to explain every approach and the logic/reasoning behind it. This page is meant for users to only review their code and see how their solution can be optimized or improved upon, this will help grow their coding skills and understanding of algorithms. AI code suggestions or comments for the users code can also be given in the same component to provide more information.

- Overall I aimed for my design to be minimalistic and easily understood. I want to reduce noise and only provide information that is neccessary for the user to learn and grow. The layout of the page is intuitive and the color choices are kept simple to reduce noise.


## Notes

- Although the actual audio is removed, I believe once the product offers video camera recordings we can include the audio in a section with the video. This section will be focused on body language, tone of voice, changes in volume of speech dependent on period of the interview- such as if they sound nervous when explaining their approach. By doing this we can provide a much more wholisitc analysis of how the candidate can improve behaviorally during interviews. 

- I have many more ideas and features that I would like to share. Looking forward to talking soon!
